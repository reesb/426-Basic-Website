		<h2>
			What is The Legend of Zelda?
		</h2>

		<p>
			<img height="300" src="windwaker.jpg" style="padding: 0 15px; float: right;" width="210" alt="windwaker.jpg"> The Legend of Zelda is a
			action-adventure video-game series created by Japanese game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It is
			primarily developed and published by Nintendo, although some portable installments and re-releases have been
			outsourced to Capcom, Vanpool and Grezzo. The series' gameplay incorporates elements of action, adventure and
			puzzle-solving games.
		</p>

		<p>
			The series centers on Link, the playable character and chief protagonist. Link is often given the task of rescuing
			Princess Zelda and the kingdom of Hyrule from Ganon, who is the principal antagonist of the series; however, other
			settings and antagonists have appeared in several games. The plots commonly involve a relic known as the Triforce, a
			set of three omnipotent golden triangles. The protagonist in each game is usually not the same incarnation of Link,
			but a few exceptions exist.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since the original The Legend of Zelda was released in 1986, the series has expanded to include 19 entries on all of
			Nintendo's major game consoles, as well as a number of spin-offs. An American animated TV series based on the games
			aired in 1989 and individual manga adaptations commissioned by Nintendo have been produced in Japan since 1997. The
			Legend of Zelda is one of Nintendo's most prominent and successful franchises, selling over 80 million copies as of
			2017; many of its games are considered by critics to be among the greatest video games of all time.
